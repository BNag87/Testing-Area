# Testing Ground

This project is for testing ideas or creating tutorial projects for different purposes. All cases are created as [Components] in the src/Components folder and then used with React.

## Current Components
[Merchant Generator]
This creates a list of items sellable by merchants in DnD5e. 
Currently in development as of 14/04/22.

[NPC Generator]
A component that generates a random NPC for DnD5e. Functionally complete but needs further work
to 'save/load' characters by connecting to a mongodb database.

[Expanding Clickable Table]
This fills data from an array of character objects into several input boxes.
Object definitions are set in another file in the components folder.

[Websockets]
Practice for sending data between devices.
